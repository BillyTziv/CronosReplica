# Cronos Replica
Replicates the login procedude of student login information panel at University of Ioannina. It uses curl function of PHP to set all the necessary parameters and create the right HTTPS query. After the login, personal data are displayed in a data table.

Due to the graduation restrictions I can no longer login to the system but this is the login page created.
